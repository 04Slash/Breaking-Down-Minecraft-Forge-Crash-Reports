# Breaking-Down-Minecraft-Forge-Crash-Reports

This repository was created with the aim to help people self diagnose crash reports for Modded Minecraft, targeted at the Forge modloader. I will also have a section for issues I frequently see and have a clear solution. This repository is a work in progress and will be updated over time when I have the time to continue working on it.

**All information can be found in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/04Slash/Dissecting-Crash-Reports/wiki).**

**Anyone is free to use and/or take the information found on this Github page without having to ask for permissions.**
